                <p> Indonesia is one of the most popular place to surf on asia, but due to a hot contender closing in on its tail, and that's the epic breaks of Sri Lanka's stunning coastlines.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Midigama</b> is located on Sri Lanka's south coast which is south of Galle. It has a few gnarly reef breaks such as Ram's Right which is suited to the more experienced surfer. It is the best spot to surf reef breaks as the waves aren't too powerful with a combination of lefts and rights waves suited to most surfers.
                <br>
                <b>Arugam Bay</b> This is the stretch of coastline that most avid surfers come to Sri Lanka to surfe. Arugam Bay has one of the longest right point breaks in the country with consistent swell during April to September. Arugam Bay can get quite crowded in peak season but don't worry there are a stack of other breaks around the area such as Baby Point producing a gentle break to Peanut Farm which is for the more advanced surfer. Even if you're not a surfer, visiting Arugam Bay is one of the top things to do in Sri Lanka.
                <br>
                <b>Weligama</b> situated south east of Galle, Weligama is a place to go for beginner to novice surfers with a mix of breaks located along its majestic coastline.</p>
                <p>It usually cost around 500 LKR for half a day (6 hours) and 1000 for a full day</p>

                        <p>The both of them are in the same part of Sri Lanka.The Ella Gap provides remarkable views, spanning right from the nearby greenery of Ella Forest Reserve all the way out to the Great Basses lighthouse on the south coast. It's quiet in Ella, but there's a lot of things to do. You can visit tea factories, photograph the Nine Arch Bridge, or you can go out on hiking.Ella has most of the best hike days in Sri Lanka. They're incredibly accessible and will lead you to great views. Don't forget to pick up some jackets on the way.
                        First up, the trek up Little Adam's Peak, which is 1141m and takes about an hour or maybe even less each way. This is a fairly easy hike in terms of length, but go early to beat the crowds. This is a fantastic way to see Ella, and get a feel for the layout of the land.The alternative is hiking Ella Rock, a tougher climb which will take you above the clouds. It'll tend to take a bit longeraround four hours total and if you really want to go make sure to go as early as possible, before the clouds come in. This route is less well signposted compaire to Little Adam's Peak, and involves a little walk along a railway, so make sure you know where you're going.</p>

                        <p> Hoton Plains national park is the largest plain situated in central hill of Sri Lanka. It has one of the best hikes in Sri Lanka. Tying up into a neat cirlce, the trek to World's End Cliff is remarkable. It s a cliff with a 4,000ft/1200m drop and a huge view of Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces. Make sure you wouldn't miss the majestic Baker's Falls waterfall if you go.
                        Nuwara Eliya is the closest city to the national park, 32km away, and a great place to set off from and to find some folk to share a van with or else you can ride a bike to nuwara eliya from kandy. A tuk-tuk from the city would cost around £30 GBP, or it's around £35 to hire a van. Again, make sure you go early too, or the clouds will descend and block out a lot of the views that you would've been able to see in the morning.
                        This is a popular hike with tourists because it takes around two to three hours to loop, and is not too tricky, with great rewards.</p>
