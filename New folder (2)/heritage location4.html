                <p>The old town of Galle and its fortifications were founded in the 16th century by the Portuguese under the leadership of Lorenzo de Almedia and they made there first landing at the Galle Harbor. Galle reached the height of its development in the 18th century before the arrival of the British. Portuguese captured Gall from the Sihghalese King and build its first fortress naming it "santacruz".  It is the best example of a fortified city built by Europeans in South and South-East Asia by showing the interaction between European architectural styles and South Asian traditions. Galle was first colonized by the Portuguese. In the early 17th century, the Dutch took over. They established the still existing fortress and ramparts. Also, the Dutch designed the look of the town.The old Town of Galle and fortifications is a UNESCO World heritage cultural site.</p>
