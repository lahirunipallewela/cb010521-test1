                <p>one of the main features of Sigiriya rock is Sigiri graffiti.They were written on the surface of the Mirror Wall at Sigiriya.There are are over 1800 pieces of prose, poetry and commentary written by ancient tourists on the wall. These graffiti offer a fascinating insight into the history of Sigiriya and the evolution of language in Sri Lanka over a period of 800 years. The majority of the graffiti refer to the beautiful paintings of semi-nude females. These graffiti confirm about residence of King Kashyapa who ruled from 477 to 495 AD. 
                <br>
                Many poems are written  in a Sinhala, Sanskrit and Tamil. These early scribblers have left us priceless insights into the past. Most of the proplr in the paintings has been identified accourding to ther socail rank , name and from the town they came from..</p>
