                    <p>The main reason for the historical city of Anuradhapura to become a sacred city was the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi.Even though it is hard to believe; but without a doubt—that this small tree with limbs so slender that they must be suppo rted on iron crutches, is the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world (2,200 years).
                    <br>
                    A branch of the very Bo beneath which is at Buddha Gaya in North India ,the Buddha himself found Enlightenment, was brought to Sri Lanka in the 3rd Century B.C. by the Princess/religieuse Sanghamitta; a sister of the saint Mahinda.
                    <br>
                    It has never since been without its hereditary attendants and the care, to the very end, of the country's kings. As lately as the reign of the last of them (Sri Vikrama Rajasingha, whom the British captured and deported); a wall was built by royal command to repair the platform on which it grows. In 1966 it was enclosed in a golden railing.

                <p>A roof of copper over this primordial skyscraper bestowed upon it, its name. This work of Duttha Gamini is known to have burned down only 15 years after its building; which leads to the surmise that it was largely a wooden structure.
                <br>
                The 1,600 pillars ( that now mark the site are historically ascribed to king Parakrama Bahu the Great (1153—1186 A.D.) of Polonnaruwa. The original building was of 9 graded stories and is said to have had one thousand rooms.</p>

            <p>The Mahathupa also known as Great Thupa is today known as the Ruvanveliseya Dagaba. This is the centre piece of The Maha vihara also known Great Monaster. 
            <br>
            A dagaba or thupa (relic chamber), is a dome which is built over sacred relics, the bodily remains of the Buddha. King Duttha Gamini had already built the Mirisavati and his magnificent Brazen Palace, but he wanted something bigger and better for his greatest work.It is said that this cost the king 6.4 million coins in wages, and that the workers received food and clothing and a considerable 'extras' for the work.On top of this beautiful 'bubble' shaped Mahathupa was a ruby as big as a man's fist, and today the Burmese people have donated a rock crystal, which is 2 feet high (60cm) to replace it.</p>

            <p>Jethavanaramaya Dagaba was originally build of height of 400 feets by making it the third largest building in the world at that time.
            <br>
            King Mahasena built this massive dagaba in the 3 <sup>rd</sup> century AD.The structure is significant in the island's history for it represents the tensions within the Theravada and Mahayana sects of Buddhism.The sectarian differences between the Buddhist monks also are represented by the stupa as it was built on the premises of the destroyed mahavihara, which led to a rebellion by a minister of King Mahasena.This stupa belongs to the Sagalika sect. The compound covers approximately 5.6 hectares and is estimated to have housed 10,000 Buddhist monks.
