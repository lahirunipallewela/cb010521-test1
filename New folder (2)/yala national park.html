                <p>Yala national park also known as Ruhuna national park is located in the south eastern regions of Sri Lanka and it covers over two provinces of Hambanthota district of Sothern province and Monaragala district in Uva province. The entrance to the park is at Palatupanna which is 12km from Kirinda.From all of the national parks in Sri lanka , the Yala National Park gives the best opportunity to witness Ceylon's broad variety of wildlife.Yala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and was designated a national park in 1938. Ironically, the park was initially used as a hunting ground for the elite under British rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world's biggest concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodile.The best time to visit Yala is when the water level in the park is quite low which brings animals into the open, usually between February and July.for the most reliable wildlife sightings , people says that it best to cisit yala in the dry season from February to June. At this thime of the year the water level is lower so it's easier to sport animals coming out to the lagoons to drink. The park normally closes in month of September each year for maintainence.The Temperagers in yala usually around 29 degrees throughout the year. Even through Sri Lanka is prone to rain all year round,the northeast monsoon tends to hit the park from septamber to December.at this time it rains quite heavily. </P>
